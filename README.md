# Warcry-Anvil-of-Apotheosis

A translation of the generic Anvil of Apotheosis character creator from Age of Sigmar to Warcry.

I'm aware there are fighter creators out there, but I wanted to make something that was a bit more of a structured framework for users to more easily pick up. The idea is that this could then be expanded into faction-specific AoA creators too.

## Points 
Base values for fighters were determined using existing fighter profiles with some modifications. When you compare across factions you do see some discrepancies in pricing, which carries across here to an extent. I've tried to deal with it where possible - the end result is that fighters won't always come out as competitively priced vs. standard fighters, but given the flexibility introduced here I think that's acceptable.

Equipment options were pointed using a custom algorithm (linear regression completed on existing profiles, including all FAQ points updates).
